**Using to break up a long interview**
- file and folder structure is important
- make a folder for each interview and put the source file in it (necessary as it creates in current folder)
- choose the interview you want to work with 
- highlight the text you want to extract and select the hotkey 
- the highlighted text will be encased in a an extracted message and copied into a new file in the folder with incrementing file name that uses the folder name - a link is also added to the extracted quote file


**Coding**
- go through the itemised files using backlinks as your coding names (idea from [https://forum.obsidian.md/t/using-obsidian-for-qualitative-analysis-a-starter-environment/22391](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/using-obsidian-for-qualitative-analysis-a-starter-environment/22391 "https://forum.obsidian.md/t/using-obsidian-for-qualitative-analysis-a-starter-environment/22391"))
- using backlinks allows you to rename them and gives you an file to make notes. Nice idea!
