P2: I think i was really aware of my body mainly then trying to  to kind understand the sounds but I actually found that whgan you work with someone else you actualy start to understand some of better because you are trying to figure out you're doing what they're doing... both my my hands it was like harder  to distinguish, which was why i was working more with my body shape within the space rather than with just my handss: ok yup
