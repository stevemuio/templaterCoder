**Setting up Obsidian for coding interviews or anything**
These files are my Obsidian structure for extracting quotes form a longer text with a view to then using Grounded Theory or other coding system for qualitative analysis.  Strikes me it could be used for any longer text.

NOTE!
It's a working system and has a tick bow enabled that allows the Templater plugin to run System wide commands.  You do this at your own risk.  Please back up your research data. Always drag and drop files into Obsidian or copy them into the vault folder.

You will be asked to operate in safe mode.  You need to turn this off to use community plugins.


**Using Templater to break long interview into quotes and items**
- install Templater and enable
- create Template folder
- copy template files in
- Templater settings
	- set template folder
	- set hotkey e.g. ^m for "highlightToNew.md" (rest work from selection)
	- enable System commands - for clipboard
- In settings files - set new file to be created in current folder


**Using to break up a long interview**
- file and folder structure is important
- make a folder for each interview and put the source file in it (necessary as it creates in current folder)
- choose the interview you want to work with
- highlight the text you want to extract and select the hotkey
- the highlighted text will be encased in a an extracted message and copied into a new file in the folder with incrementing file name that uses the folder name - a link is also added to the extracted quote file


**Coding**
- go through the itemised files using backlinks as your coding names (idea from [https://forum.obsidian.md/t/using-obsidian-for-qualitative-analysis-a-starter-environment/22391](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/using-obsidian-for-qualitative-analysis-a-starter-environment/22391 "https://forum.obsidian.md/t/using-obsidian-for-qualitative-analysis-a-starter-environment/22391"))
- using backlinks allows you to rename them and gives you an file to make notes. Nice idea!
